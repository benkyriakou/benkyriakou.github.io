        <p>If you sound like a robot on Zoom, but not on other voice recordings, you might need to change your microphone settings to disable voice isolation.</p>

        <p>However, the setting isn't in a very obvious place. Instead of looking in the Zoom settings, instead look for the taskbar icon that appears when the settings are open and disable voice isolation.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure why this causes issues&mdash;my theory is that because I'm using a cardioid microphone the lack of background noise confuses the voice isolation. In any case, turning this off fixed the issue. Hope this helps!</p>
